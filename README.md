# END-TO-END-DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECT

This project builds and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
The dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes like airplane, cat, and truck.
The model architecture includes Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, and Dense layers.
Training accuracy and validation performance are visualized, and predictions are shown with true vs. predicted labels.
The goal is to classify images accurately and demonstrate image classification using deep learning.
